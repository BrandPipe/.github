## BrandPipe in a nutshell

We are a UK-tax paying, founder/employee-owned, debt-free group of software and technology companies trading since 2013. Our specialism is creating and operating strategically-important custom systems, and we turn our hand to diverse needs all the time.

In addition, BrandPipe has a growing portfolio of its own software products and intellectual property which it licences to clients.
